[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing student developers into open source software development. Students are sponsored by Google to work with a mentoring open source organization on a 3-month programming project during the summer. Over the past 16 years, 16,000+ students have participated in Google Summer of Code.

This year we‚Äôre thrilled to announce that CircuitVerse is a mentoring organization in Google Summer of Code 2021 for the *third time* in a row!
This is a proud moment for us, especially since it has been only 5 years since we started out, and we are witnessing an exponential growth - thanks to our ever-growing open source community. üöÄ
