This blog is about the work we have done and goals we have accomplished in the GSoC'22.

Let's Dive in...

## Project Description
CircuitVerse is a Digital Logic Simulator on web. It is an educational tool for students interested in electronics to simulate and make circuits on their browser.

This project aimed to improve the main platform by integrating new features. So intially the project consist of 6 features but after mentor discussion we have added more features into the project context.

## Project goals
The features we have successfully implemented:
- gitlab authentication integration
- sso integration
- Support multiple mentors for groups
- Improve embed feature
- Assignment restriction
- noticed integration (Notification Page)
- notification api(Mobile-app).

### Feature: gitlab authentication integration
This feature enables user to authenticate using thier gitlab account in CircuitVerse. For achieving this, I used `omniauth-gitlab` gem. Initially, I faced issues because of the old version of omniauth gem in CircuitVerse, so I first update the gem along with it's dependencies and configurations. After omniauth update, gitlab authentication works smoothly. I also updated the documentation to integration application for config.

**PR**
- [build(deps): bump omniauth from 1.9.1 to 2.1.0](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3071)
- [feat: gitlab authentication integration](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3154)

### Feature: SSO Integration

SSO stands for Single-Sign On. I have used `devise_saml_authenticatable` gem. For the testing I used Okta IDP. I faced issues during integration but as always mentor guided me the way, and I was able to solve it.

**PR**
- [feat: sso integration](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3167)

### Feature: Support Multiple Mentors Support in Group

This feature enables group to have multiple mentor. There will be 1 primary mentor(owner), and primary mentor can add mentors, make member a mentor and vise-versa. Mentors can grade, CRUD, and reopen assignments. Ruturaj has already raised a PR for it and had implemented mot of the stuffs, but there is still need to rafactor, cleanup and stimulus JS migration.

**PR**
- [Feature: Support multiple mentors for groups](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/2096)
- [[documenation] : Support Multiple Mentors](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerseDocs/pull/334)

### Feature: Improve embed feature
Initially the embed feature was basic. This feature advance it by providing the customization options. When a user click on embed button, a popup will be displayed with the options to customize your embed.
The customization options:
- Iframe width and height.
- Border width and color.
- Optionally Disable stuff like Clock Enable/Clock-Time, Interval/Zoom, Display Name.
- Change theme.

Kartikay already have made a PR with the integration for Iframe width & height, border with & color. I worked on integrating advance options, revamp and cleanup.


**PR**
- [Improve embed feature](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/2768)

### Feature: Assignment restriction
We already have element restrictions for the assignment i.e., to restrict the group members with the use of elements for the Project. 
But we have got quite a few complaints from professors that CircuitVerse allows cheating easily. For example, users can easily copy/paste any public circuit. They can give collaborators access to their own circuit and copy-paste etc. So it has been requested by professors to disable this feature. This PR enables that feature into CircuitVerse.

**PR**
- [feat: assignment restriction](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3091)

### Feature: Improve Notification Page

Notifications are very important aspect, we were using `activity_notification` gem before, but it makes the page lacky and the gem is not maintained any more, so we decided to shift to new gem, and we found `noticed` gem for it.

Noticed gem is really very easy to use and had really cool and amazing features. You can learn about the noticed gem [here](https://github.com/excid3/noticed).

We have covered 2 events for notification:
- Notify the author when someone forks the project.
- Notify the author when someone stars the project.

We have implemented a section in the navbar to get quick access to your notification.

#### Notification Page

Notification page for a respective user shows all the notification for the user logged in. You can mark a notification as read by clicking to it, or you can click **mark_all_as_read** to mark all notifications as read.

#### Challenges
The noticed implementation was comparatively easy, but the major challenge was to migrate the old data under the `activity_notifications` as both gem have different implementation, different schemas and methods. So we finally made a data migration file in which we made a script to migrate the data from `notification` table to `noticed_notification` table.

**PR**
- [feat: noticed integration (Notification Page)](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3243)

> We also reimplemented the web push notification, for which the PR is under review! There are some production issue we are facing, we are trying to solve it!

### Feature: Notification api(Mobile-app).

Notification api is used to provide the different endpoints for the Mobile-app. 

#### Endpoints:

- GET `/api/v1/notifications`

To get all the notification for current authorized user.
- PATCH `/api/v1/notifications/mark_as_read/:notification_id`

To mark a particular notification as read.
- PATCH `/api/v1/notifications/mark_all_as_read`

To mark all notifications as read.

**PR**
- [feat: notifications api](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3259)

### Future Goals
We initially had some more features in the bucket list:
- Weekly Contest.
- Suggest tags for Project.

We will research and will work on these goals after gsoc!
