### DO NOT CHANGE BLOG PATH

The goal of this blog is to showcase the work done by [Vaibhav Upreti](https://github.com/VaibhavUpreti) on [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/)
during Google Summer of Code 2023. 

**CircuitVerse** is a free, open-source platform which allows users to construct digital logic circuits online.
For a detailed description of the project, please refer to the [project page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2023/projects/r2R8ARJ9).
