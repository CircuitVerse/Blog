> **TL;DR** — I migrated key UI elements like the Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, and more to ViewComponents for better maintainability; revamped UIs for the Navbar, Landing Page, and Search features with RTL support; enhanced search with sorting, filtering, and performance optimizations via counter caches. Immense thanks to mentors **[Vedant Jain](https://github.com/vedant-jain03)**, **[Aman Asrani](https://github.com/Asrani-Aman)**, and org admin **[Aboobacker MK](https://github.com/tachyons)**.

## Introduction

I’m Harsh Bhadu, also known as [senbo1](https://github.com/senbo1) on GitHub. I'm a passionate developer with an interest in web technologies, UI/UX design, and open-source contributions. This summer, I participated in GSoC 2025 with CircuitVerse, working on modernizing the platform's UI and improving user search experiences.

---

## Project Scope and Objectives

My GSoC 2025 project focused on migrating UI elements to ViewComponents to enhance code modularity and maintainability, while also revamping key interfaces and optimizing the search functionality for better performance and usability. This work directly contributes to a more scalable, accessible, and user-friendly CircuitVerse platform.

---

## Project Scope and Initial Requirements

The primary objectives outlined in my GSoC proposal were:

- Migration to View Components: Improve maintainability and scalability.
- Search Experience Improvements: Optimize search performance (resolve N+1 queries) and enhance UI/UX with better filtering, sorting, and seamless updates.
- UI Improvements: Fix existing UI bugs, reduce CSS redundancy using Bootstrap utility classes, and ensure overall consistency.
- UX Enhancements: Streamline critical user flows like email verification and improve homepage navigation.
- RTL Language Support: Adapt the UI for Right-to-Left languages to improve accessibility.

---

## Project Evolution and Delivered Outcomes

By the end of GSoC, my contributions included:

- Extensive migrations of UI partials to ViewComponents (e.g., Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, Contribute Card, Pagination, OAuth links).
- UI revamps for the Navbar, Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, and the entire Landing Page, all with built-in RTL support.
- Search enhancements including sorting by different criteria (with counter caches for performance), filtering by tags/countries/institutes, and modular Stimulus controllers for interactive UI.
- Various fixes for nil checks, translations, and code cleanups to improve consistency and reliability.

---

## Rationale for Scope Adaptation

The project adapted based on mentor feedback, design iterations in Figma, and priorities for immediate impact. We prioritized ViewComponent migrations and UI revamps early to build a strong foundation, then shifted to search optimizations in Phase 2. Some elements like email verification were planned but deferred to post-GSoC due to time constraints, allowing deeper focus on core UI and search features. This evolution ensured production-ready, high-value deliverables while aligning with community needs.

---

## Technical Implementation and Contributions

My contributions centered on modernizing CircuitVerse's frontend architecture and enhancing user interactions. Starting with design discussions in Figma, I finalized UIs for search and key components.

I began by migrating various partials to ViewComponents, which improved reusability, testability, and isolation. For instance, [#5493](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5493) migrated OAuth links, adding tests and previews. This pattern continued with [#5811](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5811) for the Search Bar (introducing parameters for customization), [#5813](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5813) for User Cards, [#5815](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5815) for Project Cards (simplifying helpers), [#5830](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5830) for Contribute Cards (with SCSS updates), and more.

UI revamps followed, aligning with Figma designs and adding RTL support. [#5833](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5833) revamped the Navbar, [#5839](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5839) updated the Search Bar for responsiveness and RTL, [#5862](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5862) modernized Project Cards with grid layouts and "Show More" buttons, [#5870](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5870) refreshed User Cards with translations, and [#5875](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5875) overhauled the Landing Page (Hero, Features, Testimonials, CTAs) using modular components—now live in production.

For search improvements, I addressed performance by adding counter caches in [#5946](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5946) for efficient sorting by stars/projects count, integrated a Stimulus controller for dynamic UI, and ensured I18n support. [#6001](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/6001) (WIP) adds filters like multi-select tags for projects and country/institute for users, with Apply/Clear buttons and state preservation.

Fixes included [#5825](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5825) for nil checks in notifications and [#5889](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/5889) for search bar translations. These efforts reduced CSS redundancy, fixed bugs, and ensured consistency across RTL and mobile views.

Outside scope, I created good first issues and collaborated on cross-project tasks, like coordinating with other contributors on View Components and other small tasks.
