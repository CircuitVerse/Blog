> **TL;DR** — I migrated key UI elements like the Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, and more to ViewComponents for better maintainability; revamped UIs for the Navbar, Landing Page, and Search features with RTL support; enhanced search with sorting, filtering, and performance optimizations via counter caches. Immense thanks to mentors **[Vedant Jain](https://github.com/vedant-jain03)**, **[Aman Asrani](https://github.com/Asrani-Aman)**, and org admin **[Aboobacker MK](https://github.com/tachyons)**.

## Introduction

I’m Harsh Bhadu, also known as [senbo1](https://github.com/senbo1) on GitHub. I'm a passionate developer with an interest in web technologies, UI/UX design, and open-source contributions. This summer, I participated in GSoC 2025 with CircuitVerse, working on modernizing the platform's UI and improving user search experiences.

## Project Scope and Initial Requirements

My GSoC 2025 project focused on migrating UI elements to ViewComponents to enhance code modularity and maintainability, while also revamping key interfaces and optimizing the search functionality for better performance and usability. This work directly contributes to a more scalable, accessible, and user-friendly CircuitVerse platform.

The primary objectives outlined in my GSoC proposal were:

- Migration to View Components: Improve maintainability and scalability.
- Search Experience Improvements: Optimize search performance (resolve N+1 queries) and enhance UI/UX with better filtering, sorting, and seamless updates.
- UI Improvements: Fix existing UI bugs, reduce CSS redundancy using Bootstrap utility classes, and ensure overall consistency.
- UX Enhancements: Streamline critical user flows like email verification and improve homepage navigation.
- RTL Language Support: Adapt the UI for Right-to-Left languages to improve accessibility.

## Project Evolution and Delivered Outcomes

By the end of GSoC, my contributions included:

- Extensive migrations of UI partials to ViewComponents (e.g., Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, Contribute Card, Pagination, OAuth links).
- UI revamps for the Navbar, Search Bar, Project Card, User Card, and the entire Landing Page, all with built-in RTL support.
- Search enhancements including sorting by different criteria (with counter caches for performance), filtering by tags/countries/institutes, and modular Stimulus controllers for interactive UI.
- Various fixes for nil checks, translations, and code cleanups to improve consistency and reliability.

## The Work I Did

My journey started during the community bonding period, where I synced up with mentors Vedant Jain and Aman Asrani to map out a clear roadmap using GitHub Projects. We coordinated with fellow contributor Aditya Singh on overlapping tasks like explore page, N+1 queries, etc, setting the stage for collaborative progress. One early challenge was handling large pull request for the Header migration which I broke into smaller, focused ones, which streamlined reviews and accelerated merges.

Diving into ViewComponent migrations, I transformed various partials to enhance reusability and testability. For example, starting with Text Editor and progressing to the Search Bar, where I introduced customizable parameters, these changes isolated components and made testing a breeze. This modular approach not only reduced code duplication but also sped up development cycles, a key learning that shaped my workflow.

Before working on the UI revamps, we had async communication with UI Lead Nitin who provided valuable feedback on the Figma designs, ensuring our implementation would meet design standards and user experience goals. The UI revamps were particularly exciting, aligning closely with Figma designs while baking in RTL support from the outset to avoid costly rework later. Revamping the Navbar involved modernizing its look and ensuring seamless RTL compatibility, which was crucial for users in Arabic, other RTL Languages. Similarly, updating the Project Card introduced grid layouts, making it more interactive and responsive. I remember iterating on the User Card's translations and the Contribute Card's SCSS updates, addressing mentor feedback to polish these elements.

The Landing Page overhaul stands out as one of the largest UI efforts. It involved modularizing components like feature card, badge element, Stats card into View Components, ensuring everything matched the approved design and supported RTL. Seeing it merge and go live in production was a thrilling milestone—it now greets CircuitVerse's users with a fresh, inviting interface.


Shifting to search improvements in Phase 2, I tackled performance bottlenecks by implementing counter caches for stars and project counts, enabling efficient sorting without heavy queries. Integrating a Stimulus controller added dynamic UI flair, like auto-submitting on resource changes for a smoother experience. The filters feature, currently in Review as of writing this report, brings multi-select tags for projects and dropdowns for user countries and institutes, complete with Apply/Clear buttons to preserve state.

Throughout, I fixed bugs like nil checks in notifications and added translations for the Search Bar, reducing CSS redundancy and ensuring mobile consistency. Beyond my scope, I created "good first" issues and collaborated on some view components, embodying the open-source spirit.
